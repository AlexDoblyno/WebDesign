        Who is Spy is a game that you can play with your friends. The game is played by at least 5 players, and each is assigned a word. Each player needs to describe their own word. While the spy's word is different, he needs to describe it, while not being caught by the others. The blank player has no words but also needs to pretend, When he can guess the word of the others while not being caught, he wins the game.

      </p>

      <p>
        The website only provide as a counter, showing words and which turn is it. You still need to communicate with your friends to play the game.
